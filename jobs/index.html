    <h2>Recruitment process</h2>

    <p>If you have already applied for a job at Allegro or would like to ask about further steps read on to get more insight on Allegro Tech recruitment process.</p>

    <h3>Home assignment</h3>
    <p>As a home assignment you are to write a simple REST service that meets given requirements. Task difficulty has been calibrated so that it can be completed
        in 4 to 5 hours of work, with a total of a few hundred lines of code. You submit the task in form of a pull request reviewed by an Allegro engineer.
        This reflects our daily practices when working with code and gives you the chance to explain the design or even apply some fixes based on our
        engineer’s suggestions.</p>

    <h3>Craftsmanship/workshop</h3>
    <p>During this part of the interview process we focus on skills used in day-to-day work on single microservice. We talk about good development practices,
        programming languages and known frameworks. We care not only about software quality, but also performance, reliability and metrics of our services,
        thus expect questions about making things fast or implementation details of your platform of choice. You might be asked to perform code review
        focused purely on good practices (i.e. no hunting for syntax mistakes or code parsing).</p>

    <h3>Algorithms and architecture</h3>
    <p>&bdquo;Algorithms and architecture&rdquo; is a conversation about more abstract and high-level aspects of programming. Our starting point
        is designing a system which adds a new feature to Allegro (proposed by the interviewer). We pay attention to problem-solving skills and ability
        to think about the whole system from both user and technical perspective. Knowledge of concrete technologies, while a welcome addition,
        is not as important as those abilities. We ask questions about scalability, performance and fault-tolerance of designed system.</p>

    <h3>HR/Leader</h3>
    <p>During this interview, we evaluate candidate’s soft skills, including communication and teamwork skills, focus on usability, analytical
        thinking and work motivation. Moreover, we assess candidate’s cultural fit in the workplace and to the team – whether they share similar
        values and are able to align to our work standards. It is likely that the candidate’s future boss will take part in this meeting as well.</p>
