We often hear about the importance of exchanging knowledge and practices between totally different teams. However, less
often do we hear concrete suggestions for how to do it. In this article, we discuss one of our practices to tackle the
problem.

## What is team tourism?

The idea behind team tourism is simple. For a fixed period of time (for example one or two Scrum Sprints), one team
member joins another team to work there. In most of the cases, we aim to do something different from our daily routine
work. Naturally, in most of the cases, his or her efficiency is extremely low, but the long term benefits are
overwhelming.

Other terms used for what we call “team tourism” are “exchange” or “rotations”. Although, they may look similar, in is
highly likely that they deliver the same value.

## The incentive

There are many reasons why we would like to change teams. Not only are there benefits for participants, but also for the
company. In this section I will discuss reasons why do this.

First of all, there is a mutual exchange of knowledge. The person who is on the exchange can provide a fresh look at
existing problems, as well as, he or she can bring new practices to his or her home team. The opportunity to observe
different teams and their strategies of solving problems can force us to rethink processes in our team.

Next, many developers want to learn new technical skills. For example, if your team is focused on backend engineering,
it may be a good opportunity to practice frontend skills. For many of us, it was a big step out of our comfort zone. You
may be a senior in your area of expertise, but suddenly you are in a totally different role where you are a complete
beginner.

On the other hand, you may decide to go to the other team to explore your interest in some technology even more. During
the exchange period, you should focus on one, and only one thing which interests you the most, to achieve a specific
goal.

Boredom, burnout, monotony may happen to each of us. By working for too long on single project you may want to refresh
yourself. In that case, team tourism will probably have vast impact on your morale.

If the product is enormous, it is often hard to keep track of all its aspects. As a result, different departments are
focused on totally different business requirements. While working in different teams, you may see other points of view
which may be entirely beneficial.

What if this goes so well, that person on the exchange wants to stay? It is also possible and we do not say ‘no’. Of
course that decision should not be immediate, and more measured actions should be taken. Regardless of that, team
tourism is a good place when you want to potentially change your team permanently.

Last but not least, we decide to do that kind of exchange, because the team needs it. The person who is going to the
exchange may go there in order to help the team achieve its goal. To illustrate, we may want to do this to remove some
obsolete library from the project or reduce technical debt. Or quite the contrary, to introduce a new library or
redesign existing peace of software.


## How to organise it?

Truth to be told, we don’t have strict rules or procedures how to do that. Whereas other companies embrace explicit
procedures, we mostly try to follow common sense, which can be described in a few sentences.

### Before the exchange

First of all, the need for team tourism should be clarified. In most of the cases, team member
proposes the exchange, but there are cases when a leader can propose it for someone else.

When there is a desire to go on an exchange, both teams and the person who will be on the exchange have to agree on:
What is the goal of the exchange? How long it should take? When to do it? How to handle other duties, for example being
on call. Notice that deciding how long it should take is completely different question from when to do it.

When you ask yourself the question about the length, it should be long enough to fulfil the goal of the exchange, but
short enough not to cause any problems with your origin team deliverables. On the contrary, when discussing the time to
do it, you should keep in mind different scrum teams, different times of sprint start and end dates. Most common
situation is that the exchange should take two weeks. Ideal situation is that two teams starts its sprints on the same
day. In practice it is rarely the case, so it is necessary to reach a compromise.

### After the exchange
When the dust settles, and the exchange is over, person on the exchange should summarise it. We
do not impose the form. It should be in the form of the note, presentation or other way of sharing knowledge. It is
often summarised what was done or what was learnt during that period of time.

## How to facilitate team tourism from day one

People who work for several years in an organisation usually have
resistance to change teams, context or design. It is consistent with our habits and our human nature. We tend not to
leave our comfort zones, which in this case is the team, What helps, is building a culture of tourism from the very
beginning of our work. At Allegro this happens in some areas in technology - each new person joining the company spends
2 to 4 weeks in 2 or 3 teams in their first 3 months of work. This greatly facilitates later tourism and makes the
desire to develop your self in this way a natural habit.

## Pitfalls

During our practice with team tourism we encountered the following problems. If you are aware of them, you
should do everything to avoid them.

If we were working from a single office, without remote working option, there would be no problem at all. Yet, we are
working in a few different cities in Poland and we can work remotely. When being on the exchange it is important to work
closely with your new team. Make sure that there will be no problems in terms of communications and locations.

Quite a common problem that we had was the inadequate length of the exchange. As a result, we finished the project (or
our task) after the return to our original team. You have to keep in mind that when learning something new or doing
something for the first time, extra time for unexpected problems must be taken into account in the planning stage.

When you are gone for the exchange, your team should be ready to work effectively without you and do not bother you with
daily routine. Unfortunately, it is easier said than done. There will always be some old task that will disrupt you or
your colleague will stop by to ask you just one single question. The team should always be prepared to cope without one
of its members.

## Summary
All in all, we believe that team tourism is a great thing to do. Not only does it enable us to be more agile,
but also help us improve our skills. Moreover, the costs of organising that kind of trips are little to none. We are
working on pitfalls that we had, and we will continue to do team tourism.

In the next few weeks we will publish five case studies written by our engineers describing their exchanges and
experiences during them. Stay tuned!
