Curiosity drives progress. There are already tens of presentations about Spotify on the Internet 
but we wanted to see how the work looks like there with our own eyes. Here are some thoughts after 
our visit to Spotify’s headquarters.

In mid February a couple of Agile Coaches from Allegro were visiting Spotify office in Stockholm, 
Sweden. It was the rank-and-file initiative as we were hungry for knowledge about how other well-known 
agile company looks like from within. Each of us had different questions inside his own head and was 
interested in different aspects of the company. I won’t write here about hard facts and show detailed 
structure of the company. You’ve probably seen presentations on the web. I’ll write about some interesting 
concepts that came to my head during the time in Spotify. At this point I would like to thank Viktor Cessan 
and Marcin Konkel for setting up this visit. OK, let’s start.

From the very first glance I realised that the company is not about software - it's about music. Big and 
small elements of interior design show that this company offers music to people. Huge TV at the reception 
playing clips and Spotify commercials, band t-shirt Mondays, recording studio where you can do jam sessions, 
conference rooms named after favourite bands like "Pink Floyd", "Evanescence" or "The Doors". During my whole 
visit I had a feeling that what Spotify delivers to customers is their passion for the music. Not software, 
not mobile apps. Just music.

Second thing I felt strongly, was brand loyalty. I have seen the Spotify logo tens of times, on t-shirts, 
lanyards, jackets, walls, doors, tablets. I wouldn’t be surprised finding a guy who have tattooed it on a chest. 
If one day I were dropped by aliens in a middle of the company, after 30 seconds I would know it is Spotify. 
People are aware that it is a cool thing to work there, they seem proud of it. When asked if there are many 
companies they invite to visit, they jokingly answered that in fact companies invite themselves. Such internal 
feeling of greatness becomes a greatness radiator. When workers think that company they work for is awesome, the 
rest of the world think the same way. It doesn’t really matter if a company is cool or not, what matters is what 
employees think about the company.

Co-founders of Spotify underline the concept of having fun at work. But what does it really mean? Is this just 
fooling around all day long? Playing table tennis or foosball? No. This is just playing. Satisfying basic needs 
is not fun as well. Thinking about survival in hostile environment or who your boss is gonna be next month is not 
what is desired by employers and employees themselves. Fun at work means not encountering any obstacles which may 
prevent you from releasing your creativity. Just doing things you deem great, something that users will bless you 
for. Fun is when all you have to think of is creating something new, interesting and innovative. All the rest is 
secured by the environment in which work is done. And this is exactly how Spotify deals with it - by creating an 
environment, where all you have to think of isÉ work. When you have an idea which requires tinkering with a 
hardware - no problem, a fully equipped electronics lab is at your disposal. If app for runners requires 
testing - you have the treadmill already installed in the office to do some more valuable tests. When you’re in 
the middle of work and don’t want to think about acquiring food, because at the moment it is a waste of time for 
you, there are a couple of fridges with sandwiches and cold drinks available for free. 

Combining workplace with pleasure seems also quite interesting. Events at the office like concerts, hanging out 
with friends, drinking beer after working hours, social meetings makes you feel good at the office. Your brain 
unconsciously knows that reward awaits at this place. A reward that pulls you with a huge power every morning and 
holds you till late hours. The workplace becomes a space, where good things happen. So you love spending time there 
and you take care for this place.

What I’ve learned is that Spotify manages the environment, not people themselves. In a secure, transparent and fair 
play environment, creativity and people’s growth will flourish. Like almost every seed will grow when put into 
well-prepared soil, so will almost every employee release his full potential in well-managed workplace. Above 
mentioned examples show only some details of the office arrangement, but I’m sure it is merely a tip of the iceberg. 
I guess, with such office tweaks, mentality comes along. Mindset of openness, honesty and safety. All together 
creates a workplace, where all you have to think of is how to serve your customers. Nothing else.
