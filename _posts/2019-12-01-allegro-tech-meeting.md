Surprisingly, that’s the first time when we share with you a report from the Allegro Tech Meeting (ATM) — 
which is the 12th edition of this special event.

ATM is the tech festival dedicated from IT to IT. Every year each Allegro employee looks forward to it 
based on opinions of colleagues and the history of this meeting.

The very simple reason we’ve decided to organize such an event is the fact that from the small IT team 
we’ve raised to nearly 800 technologists in Allegro and we can’t even say hi to everyone in the everyday work.  

The ATM is the place where we can meet with each other, share our experiences and just get to know — what’s up! 

Join us in the fascinating journey through the inspiring, exciting and unique stories of Allegro 
technologists that happened on the first days of this fall.

## Intro
The 12th ATM edition was the biggest one — there were over 500 technologists from all of our offices 
scattered around Poland.

First days of the fall, gloomy weather which suit to our main theme — Blade Runner — perfectly. 

2 days of presentations, included 10 big presentations, 12 lightning talks and 7 hours party, 
1380 minutes all together that we spent on discussions about the future, tech news and simply drink beer and have fun on the dancefloor.

## Allegro Tech Heroes — special nominations
The ATM is going up a level every year and there are also some changes that makes this event more epic. 
This year there were special nominations for those  of our colleagues who have significantly influenced 
how we work, how we change and operate better and smarter as the Technology team. 
People who are using their knowledge and experience change the whole Allegro and their attitudes and 
behaviors are worth imitating.

What makes it even more special — nominations and final vote was in the hands of our IT employees. 
Congrats to all 10 Heroes who were chosen!

## Presentations
Below you will find a short description of the main part of ATM, namely, presentations! 
It would be impossible to squeeze 2 days of presentations in one article, so we've chosen a few 
that cover various cultural aspects of our organisation.

### Machine learning
#### ML for you...
Have you ever wondered what the creation and development process based on machine learning looks like? 
Isn’t it just enough to use existing algorithms/libraries, put it all together and call it a day? 
During ATM we could listen to case studies of various projects whose goals are so complicated 
that you can’t achieve any meaningful results with relatively simple statistics or rule-based system. 
*‘A human option’* is not an option (sic!) because there is too much data and gluing existing 
machine learning blocks together is no longer enough: you need to check what the current state of the art 
looks like, apply to your data, make corrections and keep your fingers crossed that it will work.

But the problem complexity shouldn’t stop us from trying to solve it! I can’t imagine 
describing e.g. fashion clothes with attributes that will be clearly understood 
by everyone (machine and people) and filtering them in order to find the same shirt/dress.
Taking into account the number of available offers on Allegro and UX we want to provide to our customers, 
the introduction of a visual search becomes a necessity! 

After encountering such problems and various use cases, you can see that a research team 
in a technology company, which wants to set trends, is a must.

#### ...and ML for me!
Culture in Allegro (and vast amount of data) encourages you to experiment with machine learning by yourself. 
Great example of this was Adam Dudczak’s talk, clickbaitly titles *'The only presentation about ML you need'*. 
Adam led us through experience gathered during bot creation for a *’Space Invaders’* clone 
simultaneously explaining basic concepts of machine learning, starting from data representation, 
model evaluation, underfitting/overfitting problem and ending on convolutional networks and 
deep reinforcement learning.
The talk contains good practice quotes and also plot twists so if you want to feel bamboozled as well, 
check the video below :)

### Technical — engineers by choice
The standard deviation of answers to the question *'how did you like the presentation?'* 
which are very specialised often is very large. As we know — it is hard to suit everyone’s tastes, 
but it is much easier to do so by talking about things used in everyday work. 

Who wouldn’t want to know more about the cluster that his application is running on, 
a new communication layer in our microservice setup or deep JVM details?
Paweł Jurczenko chose the latter subject and did a thorough overview of many topics 
related to threads on JVM. He talked about threading models, compared some concurrency primitives, 
explained challenges with non-blocking I/O and how to tune your application thread pools.

Of course we’re open to other topics — not strictly related to our day-to-day work: 
if you want to hear about some esoteric language or science stuff you definitely can! 
For example Krzysztof Szłapiński decided to tell us something about teleportation. 
But not like just normal teleportation: quantum teleportation. 
With the advent of quantum technologies we — as an audience — were really interested in how it works, 
how can we use it and what are potential problems and limitations. 
If you want to build yourself a teleporter, check Krzysiek’s presentation.

### Soft
ATM states for Allegro Tech Meeting, but man does not live by technological things alone. 
We want to share knowledge about non-technical topics as well.

#### Systems thinking — is the structure is the key?
Have you ever wondered how much interrelationships influence particular patterns of your behaviours? 
Have you experienced silent days, misunderstandings or disappointments 
when verifying the results of work in your teams? To find out what the real problem of those symptoms are 
and to support deep change in cooperation — Iza Goździeniak — 
Lean & Lead Agile Coach at Allegro — recommends to focus on the structure.
Without the awareness that we operate in structures and systems is very hard to change anything. 
Iza talked about the systems thinking in examples and the methods to see something 
more than only the tip of the iceberg. 

If you want to deep dive into particular cases - watch the video.

### Deep working — is that the fairy tale?
Context switches are computationally intensive for computers. We can say that for humans 
they are even more problematic. So it’s probably best for us to minimise them, right?  
Darek Jędrzejczyk and Ireneusz Gawlik had a presentation about work organisation challenges, 
how to restore our ability of being ‘in the flow’ and whether deep working is possible at all. 
The talk titled *‘Let me code’* was supposed to make us think if and how technology affects us 
in our everyday job and whether we use the available tools, like instant messaging platform in a good way.
Unfortunately, we can’t share this presentation with you because it contains confidential information 
about our internal infrastructure. Although you can watch 
cover of the song [Let it go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUNyUR4fY7U) played as a summary of the talk. 
Let us know what you think about this work style!


## Networking
ATM is a kind of technology celebration at Allegro. These are 2 days filled with lectures on various 
technological topics. Every employee can participate or give a presentation 
(provided it convinces others with its abstract, of course!). At a company of this size, 
ATM is one of the few opportunities to meet all the people we work with 
(or plan to cooperate) in one place.

During a normal non-ATM day we have a lot of our duties and meetings, 
so additional conversations with other teams are an addition rather than the main activity. 
However, we believe that we are able to achieve more as a whole and 
we try to spread the knowledge on ATM not only through participants, 
but also organically — by participants. From our own experience, we can confirm that less busy engineers 
willingly join technical discussions (indeed, even more willingly!), 
which leads to cool conversations and interesting ideas!
