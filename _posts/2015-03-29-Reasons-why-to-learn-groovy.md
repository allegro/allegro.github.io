title: 7 reasons why Java developer should consider learning Groovy

Groovy is a dynamic, object-oriented programming language for the Java platform. Its name comes
from slang, where “groovy” means “cool”, “amazing” or “fashionable”. This programming
language was designed to be so, but is it still *groovy* nowadays? Creator of Groovy,
James Strachan, admitted that he wouldn’t have created Groovy if he had known anything about Scala. But his project started living its own
life. Let’s take a look what it has to offer us now.

### It’s easy for Java developer
Groovy is easy. Most of the code you write in Java will compile and work as expected. Sure,
sometimes you’ll get surprised by Groovy’s behaviour, but such cases are very limited. E.g.
== operator won’t compare instances but call equals method instead. Isn’t it more intuitive though?

Learning curve for Groovy is flat, it won’t be challenging for someone who is fluent with Java.
Also you don’t need to learn everything new from Groovy — you can discover new features step by step,
so you won’t get overwhelmed.

### Groovy’s syntax is groovy
Groovy was thought and designed to be less *verbose* than Java. Unnecessary semicolons, lots of
syntactic sugar make you write faster and also without worrying about most of boiler plate code. Let’s
compare:

```groovy
// Java 7
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    System.out.println("Hello world, " + i);
}
// Java 8
IntStream.range(0, 10).forEach(i -> {
    System.out.println("Hello world, " + i);
});
// Groovy
(0..9).each {
    println "Hello world, $it"
}
```
Sure, Java 8 and Stream API is a huge step towards better expressiveness, but I believe these examples
are still way too verbose (or less expressive) in pure Java world:
```groovy
["Let’s", "create", "a", "list"] //java.util.ArrayList
["Let’s", "create", "a", "set"] as Set //java.util.LinkedHashSet

class Person {
  int id
  String name, surname
  //let Groovy compiler generate all setters and getters!
}
new Person(id: 1, name: 'John', surname: 'Doe') //named constructor parameters, only for default constructor
```

### Groovy is functional
Functional languages, although created in 1950s (Lisp), are getting popular again. More and more such
languages appear, like Clojure, Scala and our Groovy on JVM platform, Haskell and F# outside of it.
In such languages functions are first-class citizens,
what [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_function) explains this way:
>
this means the language supports passing functions as arguments to other functions, returning them as the
values from other functions, and assigning them to variables or storing them in data structures

I wouldn’t like to focus on functional aspects, but rather on the possibility to get familiar with new and completely
different programming paradigm that Groovy gives. This paradigm for Java developers might be very confusing and new.
Java 8, although is getting close to it with closures, is not fully a functional language.
[This article](http://www.beyondjava.net/blog/java-8-functional-programming-language/) explains well why.
Learning functional programming in Groovy, again, will be easy — it will just look like another feature. You will have
to start thinking in a brand new way, but without learning new syntax, like it would happen with Clojure or Scala.
But on the other hand — you’ll often have a temptation to do things in an old, known way. Every coin has two sides,
but to me ability to play with functional programming is definitely a virtue of Groovy.

### You can seamlessly integrate Groovy and Java
These two languages just work with each other. You can make Java classes call Groovy code back and forth and it will
work just fine. No special language constructions nor third party libraries. You can use this to write as following:

```groovy
import org.junit.Test
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals

public class JunitTest {

    @Test
    public void 'jUnit test written in groovy'() throws Exception {
        assertEquals(55, (0..10).sum())
    }
}
```
This is test written in Groovy, using jUnit framework (written for Java), ran by jUnit runner. Groovy and Java integrated
seamlessly. Normal Java classes will work perfectly with Groovy classes as well,  Java compiler will even see and use setters and getters
generated by Groovy.

### Beautiful tests in Spock
Example above shows that you can use good ol’ jUnit spiced with Groovy’s syntactic sugar. My favourite is naming
methods as a string containing spaces — it’s so much easier to read! But (Peter Niederwieser)[https://twitter.com/pniederw]
wished to go one step further and created a full framework that helps to write better tests — [Spock](http://spockframework.org).
It enforces you to use given-when-then sections, what helps you think of correct test construction; it gives concise and almost
graphic way to write parametrized tests; when a test fails — it shows graphically which assertion failed. Let the code speak:
```groovy
@Unroll
    def 'should sum elements from 0 to #upperLimit correctly'() {
        given:
        def listOfElements = 0..upperLimit

        when:
        def assumedSum = (1 + upperLimit) * upperLimit / 2

        then:
        listOfElements.sum() == assumedSum

        where:
        upperLimit | _
        0          | _
        10         | _
        1000       | _
    }
```
There are more arguments in favour of Spock — its homepage [sums it up nicely](https://code.google.com/p/spock/wiki/WhySpock)

### Gradle
[Gradle](http://gradle.org/) is a build tool that gains popularity rapidly. Google chose Gradle as build
tool for Android — that’s enough to say about its potential. Gradle is covered in more detail in
[this blog post](/Adopting-Gradle-at-allegro-pl-a-success-story.html). I would like to add that
you don’t need to know Groovy to use Gradle at a basic level. But knowing it gives you an actual understanding what
happens under the hood and you can get on the pro level.

### Widening your horizons
Last argument is not directly in favour of Groovy. Learning new things is always good, it widens your
horizons, you start to look at things from a different perspective. Groovy can give you insight into functional programming,
shows that things can be more concise or just better than what you know.

### Summarize
In paragraphs above I tried to show some interesting features, applications and frameworks of Groovy. The same ones that
made me actually like this language. Of course, this language has many drawbacks, its dynamic typing can often be pain in
the neck — makes refactor much harder, even IntelliJ IDEA, that makes wonders in refactoring Java, loses its power with Groovy.
If you don’t have turned on static compilation, you’ll see syntax errors only at runtime. But true power of Groovy lies in
tests and scripting, when speed of coding, ease and readability are most important matters.
