[Microservices](http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html)
are now mainstream approach for scalable systems architecture.
There are little controversy when we are talking about designing Backend services.
Well-behaved backend microservice should cover one
[BoundedContext](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/BoundedContext.html)
and communicate over REST API.
Of course, microservice should be loosely-coupled from its neighbours.

Things gets complicated when we need to
use microservices as building blocks for a Fronted solution.
So how to build a consistent website or mobile app
from tens or sometimes hundreds microservices?

In this post we describe our current Frontend approach
and the New One, meant as a small revolution.
