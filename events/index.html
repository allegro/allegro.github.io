                <p>Systems we build for the web fall across a wide spectrum of shapes and sizes. They range from monoliths
                    spanning entire businesses to networks of tiny services connected at a varying degree of coupling.</p>
                <p>In this talk we will discuss the Self-Contained Systems architecture, or SCS for short. It's an approach
                    to designing distributed systems guided by a handful of clear principles. By following them we can build
                    systems which are loosely coupled, separated along boundaries of our domain, and resilient to partial failure.</p>
                <p>After discussing principles defining SCS we will compare them to microservices and review important differences.
                    Finally, we will look at concrete examples of the SCS approach deployed out in the real world.</p>
                <p>The speaker:</p>
                <p>Jan Stępień is a senior consultant at innoQ, where he works with people and with computers. He's based in
                    Munich but you can run into him in Berlin too. Jan enjoys community events, where he often discusses
                    functional programming, architecture, and testing. He organises the Munich Clojure Meetup.</p>
