                <p>We're in the midst of renewed interest in functional programming. At the same time we see quite a bit of excitement
                    around reactive programming. Where did reactive programming come from? How is it related to functional programming,
                    if at all? In this presentation we will discuss the merits of reactive programming and how functional programming
                    concepts seamlessly transition into the programming model espoused by reactive programming.</p>
