        <div class="content"><h2 class="section-title">Open Source</h2>
            <p>We, devs and ops working in Allegro, believe that experience we gained solving problems with massive-scale deployments, high availability and robustness during our everyday work should be shared. We use Open Source solutions on daily basis, why not work on our karma and give something in return?</p>
            <p>Open source is also a way to engage with community. We hope to get feature and pull requests that will make our code better, which in turn shall make our internal platforms and services more robust and bug-proof.
