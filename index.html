            <p> At Allegro, we build and maintain some of the most distributed and scalable applications in Central
                Europe. This poses many challenges, starting with architecture and design, through the choice of
                technologies, code quality and performance tuning, and ending with deployment and devops. In this blog,
                our engineers share their experiences and write about some of the interesting things taking place at the
                company.</p>
