            <p>
                <a href="https://allegro.pl/">Allegro</a> is the most popular Polish shopping destination with about 14 million users
                monthly and over 750 thousand items sold on the platform daily. We are most of all a marketplace where companies can sell
                their products but auctions are available as well. In 2015 we started our own e-tail operations and they are
                constantly growing, adding more complexity and scale to our platform. Allegro is also getting more and more mobile,
                with over 47 million mobile searches monthly and over 130 thousand items bought on mobile devices every day.

                Making a site like this work requires a lot of engineering and as the site grows, we learn and adopt new technologies.
                What started out as a huge monolithic application is now migrating towards an ecosystem of loosely coupled
                microservices written in Java and other JVM languages running in the cloud. Creating a scalable and distributed system
                at this scale brings about many challenges which make our work interesting.

                On allegro.tech we share some of the interesting things we do, the issues we face and the lessons we learn
                (sometimes the hard way). Software development is not only about technology but also about people, so we have a Tech
                section and an Agile section as well. We hope you find these posts useful. Feel free to get in touch and comment.
