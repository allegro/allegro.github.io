        <p>
            <a href="https://allegro.pl/">Allegro</a> is a real European-born tech leader and one
            of the most recognised brands in Poland. Nowadays it is the #1 online shopping
            destination in Poland and #6 eTail business in Europe. Since 1999, we make shopping, a
            tedious everyday chore, a much more agreeable convenient experience. We save time,
            ensure comfort and convenience. We provide everyone in Poland - regardless of where she
            or he lives - online access to the broadest available selection of products in the best
            prices.
        </p>
        <p>
            Allegro marketplace currently stands for 130 million B2C and C2C offers listed a month;
            140,000 merchants accounts - not only the world's biggest brands but mostly small and
            medium Polish enterprises - selling on the platform; and over 21 million registered
            accounts. We are happy about our results but we donâ€™t rest on laurels. We want to bring
            even more Poles online. In the world of e-shopping, clients expect, above all: low
            prices, wide selection and maximum convenience. Utilizing mechanisms of deep learning,
            we focus on solutions that cater to those needs, i.a.: faster and better search,
            personalized shopping experience or development of mobile solutions.

            Making a site like this work requires a lot of engineering and as the site grows, we
            learn and adopt new technologies. What started out as a huge monolithic application and
            over the years we migrated towards an ecosystem of loosely coupled microservices
            written in Java and other JVM languages running in the cloud. Creating a scalable and
            distributed system at this scale brings about many challenges which make our work
            interesting.

            On allegro Tech we share some of the interesting things we do, the issues we face and
            the lessons we learn (sometimes the hard way). Software development is not only about
            technology but also about people, so we have a Tech section and an Agile section as
            well. We hope you find these posts useful. Feel free to get in touch and comment.
