        <h2 class="title">about allegro Tech</h2>
        <p>
            <a href="https://allegro.pl/">Allegro</a> is the most popular Polish shopping destination with about 14
            million users
            monthly and over 750 thousand items sold on the platform daily. We are most of all a marketplace where
            companies can sell
            their products but auctions are available as well. In 2015 we started our own e-tail operations and they are
            constantly growing, adding more complexity and scale to our platform. Allegro is also getting more and more
            mobile,
            with over 47 million mobile searches monthly and over 130 thousand items bought on mobile devices every day.

            Making a site like this work requires a lot of engineering and as the site grows, we learn and adopt new
            technologies.
            What started out as a huge monolithic application is now migrating towards an ecosystem of loosely coupled
            microservices written in Java and other JVM languages running in the cloud. Creating a scalable and
            distributed system
            at this scale brings about many challenges which make our work interesting.

            On allegro Tech we share some of the interesting things we do, the issues we face and the lessons we learn
            (sometimes the hard way). Software development is not only about technology but also about people, so we
            have a Tech
            section and an Agile section as well. We hope you find these posts useful. Feel free to get in touch and
            comment.
