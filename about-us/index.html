            <p>
                Allegro is the largest e-commerce site in Poland with about 14 million users.
                We are most of all a marketplace where companies can sell their products but auctions are available as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                Making a site like this work requires a lot of engineering and as the site grows, we learn and adopt new technologies.
                What started out as a monolithic application written in PHP is now migrating towards an ecosystem of loosely coupled
                microservices written in Java and other JVM languages running in the cloud. Creating a scalable and distributed system
                at this scale brings about many challenges which make our work interesting.

                On allegro.tech we share some of the interesting things we do, the issues we face and the lessons we learn
                (sometimes the hard way). Software development is not only about technology but also about people, so we have a Tech
                section and an Agile section as well. We hope you find these posts useful. Feel free to get in touch and comment.
