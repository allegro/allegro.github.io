    At Allegro, we build and maintain some of the most distributed and scalable applications in Central Europe.
    This poses many challenges, starting with architecture and design, through the choice of technologies, code quality
    and performance tuning, and ending with deployment and devops. In this blog, our engineers share their experiences
    and write about some of the interesting things taking place at the company.
