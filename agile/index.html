            <p>Agile is a ubiquitous word in the world of software development. At Allegro, we do not treat it 
			as a cliche. On the contrary, we dig in, experiment and seek our own ways of doing things. Above all â€“ 
			we change, develop and adapt to what we see, constantly following our own path. We value the courage 
			to fail and learn both as a team and as an organization. We eagerly discuss our views and experiences. 
			On this blog we would like to share our thoughts and engage in a conversation with you, participating 
			in an international community that supports each other.</p>
