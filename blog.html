      <p> Nowadays it is extremely hard to choose right technology to solve problems coming out in your application.
Open source communities offers great number of specialised languages, tools, frameworks and data processing engines.
Closing yourself in on adopting new technologies lefts your architecture obsolete and opportunities for greater performance limited.
</p>
<p>
Therefore we have decided to start sharing our experience with building one of the biggest, highly distributed applications in central-eastern Europe.
In following months we will also open source our tools we use every day in development and operations.</p>

<p>We hope so that our contribution will be valuable for the community.</p>
